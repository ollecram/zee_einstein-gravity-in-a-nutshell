## Exercises

 - Derive Snell's law: $sin \theta_{w} / sin \theta_{a} = c_{w}/c_{a} < 1$, where $c_{w}$ and $c_{a}$ denote the speed of light in water and air, respectively.
 - Suppose the ant is outside a hemispherical bowl and the drop of honey is inside the bowl directly across from her. Find the shortest distance.
 - What happens if the ant can crawl faster on the outside of the glass than on the inside? 

## Solutions

### 1 Snell's law
Given point $p=(a,b)$ in the upper (air) zone and a point $P=(A,B)$ in the lower (water) zone, assuming $a < x < A$ without loss of generality.
A light ray starting in air at $p$, traversing the air-water interface at (x,0) and continuing down to $P$ in water will travel along two consecutive rectilinear segments: .
