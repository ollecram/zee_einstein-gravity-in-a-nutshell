# Part I - From Newton to Riemann
## I.1 - Newton's Laws
### Celestial mechanics solved

$$m \ddot{\mathbf{r}} = -GMm \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r^3}$$ where $\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)$, and $r = \sqrt{\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{r}} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$

In spite of the different role played by $m$ on the left and right hand side of the equation we cancel it off from both sides, leaving
$$\ddot{\mathbf{r}} = -k \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r^3}$$ where $k \equiv GM$. 

#### Central force argument
By saying that Newton's is a ***central field***  one means that 

 - a special point exists in space (the ***field center***),
 - the ***magnitude*** of the force exerted by the field at a given point only depends on that point's distance from the center,  
 - the force ***direction*** is parallel
 -  to the segment connecting the center to that point. 

An often repeated statement says that *due to a simple "symmetry argument"* the points occupied in the course of time by a particle subject to a central force field are all contained in a plane. 

It all relates to a couple of more basic asumptions, First of all, Let see how such symmetry argument can be construed from very basic assumptions.

Assuming empty space to have no preferred direction, the only directions that may all directions one can logically make use of in
