### Celestial mechanics solved

$$m \ddot{\mathbf{r}} = -GMm \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r^3}$$ where $\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)$, and $r = \sqrt{\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{r}} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$

In spite of the different role played by $m$ on the left and right hand side of the equation we cancel it off from both sides, leaving
$$\ddot{\mathbf{r}} = -k \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r^3}$$ where $k = GM$. 

#### Central force argument
The force field being central means that by taking the origin of oneBy central force wThat the force points
