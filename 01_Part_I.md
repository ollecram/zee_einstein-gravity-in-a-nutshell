# Part I - From Newton to Riemann
## I.1 - Newton's Laws
### Celestial mechanics solved

$$m \ddot{\mathbf{r}} = -GMm \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r^3}$$ where $\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)$, and $r = \sqrt{\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{r}} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$

In spite of the different role played by $m$ on the left and right hand side of the equation we cancel it off from both sides, leaving
$$\ddot{\mathbf{r}} = -k \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r^3}$$ where $k \equiv GM$. 

#### Central force argument
By saying that Newton's is a ***central field***  one means that 

 - a special point exists in space (the ***field center***),
 - the ***magnitude*** of the force exerted by the field at a given point only depends on that point's distance from the center,  
 - the force ***direction*** is parallel
 -  to the segment connecting the center to that point. 

An often repeated statement says that *due to a simple "symmetry argument"* the points occupied in the course of time by a particle subject to a central force field are all contained in a plane. 

It all relates to the following more basic assumptions, namely that

 - There is no special point or direction in the space itself, so any special point or direction in the motion of a particle must be determined by some initial configuration of the particle's motion with respect to the field;
 - It is an experimental fact elevated to the status of an axiom in classical mechanics that the position and velocity of all particles at a given  instant of time fully determine their evolution. 

By combining the above two statements one sees that at a given point in time (hence forgetting any knowledge of prior dynamical history) there are two vectors (directions) related to a particle in a central field: the radius vector connecting the field center to the particle and the particle's velocity vector. 
These two vectors do determine a plane. By choosing the origin of our coordinate axes $(\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k})$ in the field center and the $\mathbf{k}$ axis orthogonal to the plane of motions ystem of coordinates with  system

We should now convince ourselves that should the particle trajectory deviate from that plane in the course of motion, that would violate one of our prior assumptions.
