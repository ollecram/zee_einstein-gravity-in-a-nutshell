# Part I - From Newton to Riemann
## I.1 - Newton's Laws
### Celestial mechanics solved

$$m \ddot{\mathbf{r}} = -GMm \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r^3}$$ where $\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)$, and $r = \sqrt{\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{r}} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$

In spite of the different role played by $m$ on the left and right hand side of the equation we cancel it off from both sides, leaving
$$\ddot{\mathbf{r}} = -k \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r^3}$$ where $k \equiv GM$. 

#### Central force argument
By saying that Newton's is a ***central field***  one means that 

 - a special point exists in space (the ***field center***),
 - the ***magnitude*** of the force exerted by the field at a given point only depends on that point's distance from the center,  
 - the force ***direction*** is parallel
 -  to the segment connecting the center to that point. 

An often repeated statement says that *due to a simple "symmetry argument"* the points occupied in the course of time by a particle subject to a central force field are all contained in a plane. 

It all relates to the following more basic assumptions, namely that

 - There is no special point or direction in the space itself, so any special point or direction in the motion of a particle must be determined by some initial configuration of the particle's motion with respect to the field;
 - It is an experimental fact elevated to the status of an axiom in Newton's mechanics that the position and velocity of all particles at a given  instant of time fully determine their evolution. 

By combining the above two statements one sees that at a given point in time (hence forgetting anytinitialconditions a given problem must be determined by , the only directions that may all directions one can logically make use of in
