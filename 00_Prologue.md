## Exercises

 - Derive Snell's law: $sin \theta_{w} / sin \theta_{a} = c_{w}/c_{a} < 1$, where $c_{w}$ and $c_{a}$ denote the speed of light in water and air, respectively.
 - Suppose the ant is outside a hemispherical bowl and the drop of honey is inside the bowl directly across from her. Find the shortest distance.
 - What happens if the ant can crawl faster on the outside of the glass than on the inside?
